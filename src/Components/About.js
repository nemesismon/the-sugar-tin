        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Our family grew up with food as a cornerstone of everyday life and for every special event and gathering. My mother and Grandmother were excellent cooks and bakers. We never had store bought sweets or pre-made meals. Everything was made from scratch and became staples in our recipe repertoire. Both of these role models have since passed, but I can tell you, if there is an extended family gathering at the park, Grandma’s chicken noodle soup will be front and center and my mom’s cookies and floral designs will complete the tablescape! I am very blessed to have had these strong, confident women share their talents with me. I create all my sweets based on their original recipes and have added a few tweaks of my own. Every recipe holds some memory of my mother and Grandmother, what more could I hope for!</p>
